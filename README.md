"Performance of Machine Learning Classifiers in Intrusion Detection System for VANETs"! 🌟
Introduction:
Picture this: Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) revolutionizing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) with seamless wireless vehicle communication!
🚀But hold onto your seats! While VANETs promise safer roads and fewer collisions, they're not immune to cyber threats like DoS and DDoS attacks.
😱
That's where my project comes in! We're harnessing the power of Machine Learning (ML) to fortify VANET security, specifically with Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).
💻Say goodbye to outdated datasets! We're diving into the UNSW-NB15 dataset, giving us a real-time glimpse into contemporary attacks. 📊

Dataset Used:
📊 UNSW-NB15 Dataset: Over 2.5 million records of modern network activities, collected using cutting-edge tools like the IXIA Perfect Storm, blending real and synthetic attack scenarios.
Machine Learning Classifiers Used:
🤖 Logistic Regression (LR)
🌳 Decision Tree (DT)
🎯 Support Vector Machine (SVM)
🤝 K-Nearest Neighbor (kNN)
🌌 Random Forest (RF)
🧠 Deep Learning Classifier (MLP Classifier)

Methodology:
🎯 Feature Selection: We're getting fancy with the Pearson correlation coefficient to fine-tune our feature sets, making our models lean, mean, and lightning-fast! ⚡
📊 Evaluation Metrics: We're crunching numbers with various metrics to paint a vivid picture of our models' performance. Spoiler alert: Random Forest and SVM stole the show! 🌟
🔍 This project isn't just about numbers and algorithms—it's about securing the future of vehicular communication!
